        About CozyCraze Boutique
      </h1>
      <p className="p-element">
        CozyCraze, we believe in the transformative power of comfort. Our
        journey began with a simple yet profound mission: to create spaces that
        inspire relaxation and rejuvenation. We understand that in the hustle
        and bustle of modern life, finding moments of peace is a luxury. That's
        why we've curated a boutique that goes beyond selling products — we're
        dedicated to curating an experience.
      </p>

      <h2 className="h2-element">Our Story</h2>
      <p className="p-element">
        Founded on the principles of comfort, style, and quality, CozyCraze
        started as a passion project. The idea emerged from a personal quest for
        tranquility in the midst of a hectic world. We envisioned a space where
        individuals could escape the chaos and indulge in the simple pleasure of
        comfort.
      </p>
      <p className="p-element">
        As avid seekers of serenity, we embarked on a journey to handpick the
        most luxurious and cozy items, from mattresses that cradle you in bliss
        to decor that transforms spaces into serene sanctuaries. Our team is
        driven by the belief that everyone deserves a slice of tranquility in
        their lives.
